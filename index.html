                I'm a passionate computer enthusiast with a solid foundation in programming and computer science basics.
                I've actively
                worked with languages such as JavaScript, Python, and Java, honing my skills in problem-solving along
                the
                way. My
                aspirations extend beyond the familiar, as I aim to delve into advanced concepts within computer
                science. In
                addition to
                my current language repertoire, I'm eager to explore the intricacies of languages like Rust, C, and C++,
                broadening my
                scope in the programming landscape. This journey is a testament to my commitment to continuous learning.
